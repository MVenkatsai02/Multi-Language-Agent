# AI-Powered Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This Streamlit application leverages AI agents to automate and optimize the software development process. It enables collaboration between AI-powered agents for coding, testing, research, and documentation.

## Features
- **Python Developer Agent**: Generates well-documented Python code based on user input.
- **Python Tester Agent**: Reviews and tests the generated code, writing test cases and identifying bugs.
- **Research Agent**: Fetches relevant best practices and research insights.
- **Documentation Agent**: Creates comprehensive documentation for the generated code.
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: A structured pipeline where AI agents work together to refine and finalize the output.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-multi-agent-framework.git
   cd ai-multi-agent-framework
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Obtain your **GEMINI API Key** from [Google AI](https://ai.google.dev/).
2. Enter your API key in the sidebar input field.
3. Provide a task request describing the feature or code you need.
4. Click on **Execute Task** to trigger the AI-driven development pipeline.
5. View the generated code, test results, research insights, and documentation.

## Example Workflow
1. **User Input**: "Create a function to sort a list of numbers using merge sort."
2. **Developer Agent**: Generates the merge sort function.
3. **Tester Agent**: Reviews the function and writes test cases.
4. **Research Agent**: Provides insights on merge sort efficiency.
5. **Documentation Agent**: Writes documentation explaining the function.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: Web-based UI for user interaction.
- **AGNO Framework**: AI agent orchestration.
- **Google Gemini AI**: LLM-powered code generation, testing, and documentation.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a **Deployment Agent** for cloud-based deployment automation.
- Support for multiple programming languages.
- Integration with version control systems (GitHub/GitLab).
